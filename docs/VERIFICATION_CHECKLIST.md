# Phase 5: Verification Checklist

## ‚úÖ Modularization Complete
- [x] All original code extracted into logical modules
- [x] Rendering separated into component-specific files
- [x] Projectile terminology updated (bullets ‚Üí projectiles)
- [x] HTML updated to load all modules in correct order

- [ ] **Enemy spawning** - Enemies appear in lanes correctly
- [ ] **Enemy projectiles** - Spinning candles fire from enemies
- [ ] **Collision detection** - Player hits enemies and takes damage
- [ ] **Coin collection** - Coins can be collected
- [ ] **Power-up collection** - Power-ups work correctly
- [ ] **Scoring system** - Score updates properly
- [ ] **Boss spawning** - Boss warning and boss fight trigger correctly

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
The modularized game should be **functionally identical** to the original monolithic version with:
- Same gameplay mechanics
- Same visual appearance
- Same performance characteristics
- Same audio behavior
- Same security features
