**Document Type:** Implementation Roadmap / Build Order

---

## 🎯 Priority Levels

- 🔴 **MVP Critical** - Required for launch (cannot skip)
- 🟡 **MVP Important** - Should have for launch (recommended)
- 🟢 **Post-MVP** - Nice to have (can add later)
- ⚪ **Optional** - Enhancements (not required)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### ✅ **1.1 Game Statistics Tracking** (MVP Critical) ⭐ **COMPLETED**
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocks:** Score submission, burn calculation

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add `game.enemiesDefeated` counter:
  - Increment in enemy collision/destruction logic
  - Reset at game start
- [x] Add `game.bossTiers` array:
  - Track tier when each boss is defeated: `game.bossTiers.push(game.currentTier)`
  - Reset at game start
- [x] Verify all stats are collected at game end:
  - `game.score`
  - `game.distance`
  - `game.coins`
  - `game.bossesDefeated`
  - `game.currentTier`
  - `game.enemiesDefeated` (new)
  - `game.bossTiers` (new)

**Completion Notes:**
- ✅ `enemiesDefeated` counter added and increments when enemies are destroyed in `checkProjectileEnemyCollision()`
- ✅ `bossTiers` array added and populated when bosses are defeated
- ✅ Both stats initialized in game object and reset in `restart()` function
- ✅ All stats verified on game over screen display
- ✅ Stats also displayed in real-time desktop gameplay stats panel

**Why First:** 
- ✅ **Quickest task** (1-2 hours vs 2-6 hours for others)
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** - can start immediately
- ✅ **Quick win** - builds momentum
- ✅ **Required** for score submission and burn calculation
- ✅ **Low risk** - simple code changes

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/game/main.js` (or enemy collision system)
- Boss defeat logic

**Note:** Start here! This gives you immediate progress and unblocks everything else.

---

### ✅ **1.2 Backend Infrastructure** (MVP Critical) **COMPLETED**
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Dependencies:** None (can parallel with 1.3)  
**Blocks:** All backend work

**Tasks:**

  - `@mysten/sui` (Sui SDK)
  - `typescript` (TypeScript support)
- [x] Set up basic Next.js server
- [x] Create `.env` template file
- [x] Add `/api/health` endpoint (fast, no blockchain queries) - **Required for Render free tier**
- [x] Test server runs locally

**Completion Notes:**
- ✅ Backend restructured to Next.js with TypeScript
- ✅ All dependencies updated and deprecation warnings resolved
- ✅ Health endpoint working
- ✅ Network switching configured (mainnet/testnet via SUI_NETWORK)
- ✅ Token ID configured and verified

**Files Created:**
- `backend/app/api/health/route.ts`

**Files to Create:**
- `contracts/game/sources/game.move`
- `contracts/game/Move.toml`

**Note:** Deploy to testnet immediately - don't wait for mainnet!

**Note:** **Recommended order:** Do Wallet Connection (3.1) BEFORE smart contracts. You can test wallet connection and token gatekeeping without contracts deployed. Smart contracts are only needed for score submission (Phase 4).
