## üéØ **Scoring Mechanisms**

### **1. Enemy Destruction**
Players earn points by destroying enemies with their projectiles.

| Enemy Tier | Points Awarded | Difficulty | Strategy Value |
|------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Tier 1     | 15 points      | Easy       | Basic enemies, good for practice |
| Tier 2     | 30 points      | Medium     | Moderate challenge, balanced reward |
| Tier 3     | 50 points      | Hard       | High difficulty, good point value |
| Tier 4     | 80 points      | Very Hard  | Maximum difficulty, highest reward |

**Implementation Details:**
- Points calculated as: `15 * enemyType`
- Awarded when enemy HP reaches 0
- Includes visual particle effects
- Plays destruction sound effect

### **2. Boss Combat**
Boss encounters provide the highest scoring opportunities in the game.

#### **Boss Hit Points**
- **Points**: 50 per hit
- **Trigger**: When player projectile damages boss
- **Purpose**: Rewards consistent damage dealing

#### **Boss Destruction Points**
| Boss Tier | Points Awarded | Difficulty | Time Investment |
|-----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Tier 1    | 5,000 points   | Medium     | ~60 seconds     |
| Tier 2    | 10,000 points  | Hard       | ~75 seconds     |
| Tier 3    | 15,000 points  | Very Hard  | ~90 seconds     |
| Tier 4    | 20,000 points  | Extreme    | ~120 seconds    |

**Implementation Details:**
- Points calculated as: `5000 * game.currentTier`
- Awarded when boss HP reaches 0
- Massive visual celebration effect
- Plays boss destruction sound
- Resets game speed to base level

### **3. Collection Items**
Steady score income through item collection.

| Item Type | Points Awarded | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Coins     | 10 points      | Common    | Steady income, force field activation |
| Powerups  | 25 points      | Uncommon  | Strategic value, bullet level changes |

**Implementation Details:**
- Coins: Collected when player collides with coin
- Powerups: Collected when player collides with powerup
- Both trigger visual particle effects
- Coins contribute to force field system

### **4. Continuous Gameplay**
Rewards for sustained gameplay and progression.

#### **Speed-Based Points**
- **Formula**: `Math.floor(game.speed)`
- **Frequency**: Every game loop iteration
- **Purpose**: Rewards maintaining high speed
- **Range**: 2-6 points per frame (based on speed)

#### **Distance Points**
- **Formula**: `Math.floor(distance)`
- **Frequency**: Based on distance traveled
- **Purpose**: Rewards progression through levels
- **Rate**: 1 point per distance unit

## üîí **Security System**

### **Anti-Cheat Protection**
The scoring system includes multiple layers of security:

#### **Secure Score Updates**
```javascript
function updateScore(points) {
  if (secureGame) {
    secureGame.incrementScore(points);
  } else {
    game._fallbackScore += points;
  }
}
```

#### **Score Validation**
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 500 points per second
- **Pattern Analysis**: Tracks score progression patterns
- **Checksum Validation**: Cryptographic validation of score changes
- **Session Tracking**: Monitors for suspicious activity

#### **Score History**
- **Tracking**: All score changes logged with timestamps
- **Analysis**: Pattern recognition for unusual activity
- **Integrity**: Validation against expected progression

### **Protected Game Variables**
- **Encrypted State**: Game state encrypted with session keys
- **Property Descriptors**: Score property protected from direct manipulation
- **Validation Functions**: Real-time validation of score changes

## üìà **Score Calculation Examples**

### **Example 1: Early Game (First 2 minutes)**
```
Enemy Kills: 10 √ó Tier 1 = 10 √ó 15 = 150 points
Coins: 5 √ó 10 = 50 points
Speed Points: 2.5 avg √ó 120 seconds = 300 points
Distance Points: 1000 units = 1000 points
Total: ~1,500 points
```

### **Example 2: Boss Fight (Tier 2)**
```
Boss Hits: 20 √ó 50 = 1,000 points
Boss Destruction: 10,000 points
Enemy Kills During Fight: 5 √ó 30 = 150 points
Total Boss Fight: 11,150 points
```

### **Example 3: High-Level Gameplay (10+ minutes)**
```
Enemy Kills: 50 mixed tiers = ~2,000 points
Boss Fights: 3 √ó 15,000 = 45,000 points
Coins: 30 √ó 10 = 300 points
Powerups: 10 √ó 25 = 250 points
Speed Points: 4 avg √ó 600 seconds = 2,400 points
Distance Points: 10,000 units = 10,000 points
Total: ~60,000 points
```

## üéÆ **Strategic Scoring Tips**

### **Maximizing Score**
1. **Focus on Bosses**: Highest point-to-effort ratio
2. **Maintain High Speed**: Continuous point generation
3. **Collect Everything**: Steady income from items
4. **Survive Longer**: Distance and speed points accumulate
5. **Target Higher Tiers**: Exponential point increases

### **Risk vs Reward**
- **High-Risk**: Boss fights offer massive rewards but high failure chance
- **Low-Risk**: Item collection provides steady, safe income
- **Balanced**: Enemy destruction offers moderate risk/reward

### **Progression Strategy**
1. **Early Game**: Focus on survival and basic enemies
2. **Mid Game**: Start targeting higher-tier enemies
3. **Late Game**: Boss fights become primary score source
4. **End Game**: Maximize speed and distance for continuous points
