SuiTwo PFP Builder Concept

Core Idea
To have users build their own SuiTwo Profile Picture (a fullbody digital avatar NFT with arms, legs, and feet.) Though a modular, upgradable NFT system that allows holders to customize their SuiTwo using $MEWS tokens.
The Concept
The base NFT is a Suitwo character. Users will add available items to their SuiTwo character. They will equip different wearable NFTs  to build your personal style. Each item has a unique $MEWS cost; for instance, a hoodie costs more than a chain. Each item will also have different tier/rarity levels that also determine costs. Rare items will be unlocked over time for the user to purchase. The more $MEWS a user spends on items, the more unique and valuable their Suitwo becomes. Over time, each Suitwo evolves into a completely personalized digital identity.
$MEWS Token Utility
$MEWS is used to purchase, mint, or upgrade wearables, backgrounds, or glow effects. Some rare features (like metallic colors or glowing effects) may require burning $MEWS. This creates a deflationary token economy tied directly to customization.
How It Works on SUI
SUI supports the features this system needs:
·        Dynamic NFTs (that evolve visually over time),
·        Nested ownership (Suitwo NFT owns its wearables and background NFTs),
·        Composable logic through the Move programming language.
·        System Architecture
·        Dynamic Rendering
The Suitwo's metadata updates whenever a new item, background, or glow effect is added.
Images are generated automatically via a rendering service (e.g., IPFS or custom API). The more customizations and upgrades a Suitwo has, the higher its market value. $MEWS gains long-term utility through this evolving ecosystem.
Why It's Unique
·        The first modular, evolving NFT avatar system on SUI.
·        Users can customize color, outfit, glow, and background — all as NFTs.
·        Creates a visual and token-based progression system.
·        Highly expandable: future integrations with games, metaverses, or AR experiences are natural next steps.
 
Categories can include:
·        Background colors
·        SuiTwo Base Colors
·        Glow / Energy Auras
·        Wearables:
o   Caps
o   Sunglasses
o   Chains
o   Shirts / Hoodies
o   Pants
o   Shoes
Visual Customization
1.      Base NFT - SuitwoNFT
Core NFT representing the avatar. Metadata: color, background color, glow intensity, equipped wearables, evolution level. Can "own" other NFTs (wearables + background color).
2.      Background Colors
SuiTwos can have solid-color backgrounds (e.g., black, white, pink, blue). Enhanced backgrounds can be unlocked over time. (eg. gradient variants, metallic, neons). Rare background are a separate NFT that are unlocked for long term holders(scenic backgrounds, animated).
3.      Suitwo Base Colors
Users will start with the default blue SuiTwo is blue. Other be color variants such as silver & gold will become available the longer they hold. These color versions represent rarity tiers. For example, gold and silver are ultrarare SuiTwos. Color is stored as part of the core NFT metadata.
4.      Glow / Energy Aura
Each Suitwo can also have a dynamic glow or aura effect. The glow represents energy charge, a visual symbol of how "active" or "evolved" the Suitwo is. Glows can vary in color and intensity (e.g., electric blue, fiery orange, neon purple). This could be linked to wallet activity, $MEWS balance, or NFT evolution level.
5.      Wearable NFTs
Each clothing category is a unique NFT collection. Rare Items are limited (20 each), with rarity levels and specific $MEWS prices.
